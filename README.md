#  Change youtube playback speed chrome extension

Chrome extension which allows to change youtube video playback speed from 0 to 10, by custom step. The controls are integrated with youtube player in form of: draggable bar below quality option in player settings and by specified by user keys (by default '-' or a' to subtract and '+' or 'd' to add)
